**Our Observation:**

We Played many times and observed:
- If 1st player plays -> any of the corner or diagonal centre
- 2nd player does not play -> any of the corner or diagonal centre Then, 2nd player will inevitable lose.
- The same thing also applies to 1st player. Main Idea: Use Diagonal corner and Corners

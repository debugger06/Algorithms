**Self Organizing Maps**
q3dm1-path1.csv and q3dm1-path2.csv are the contain trajectory data, i.e. sequences of vectors x(t) which indicate a human player’s 3D position at time t on the Quake III map q3dm1.


Fitted Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) to both data sets. Choosed the SOM topol- ogytobeacircularpathgraph v1 ↔v2 ↔...↔vl ↔v1 of l vertices.Experimented with different choices of l and visualized the results. The following two videos provide an idea as to how a visualization:

**Observation**
- Smaller k gives just an overview of the map
- Larger k provides very dense map
